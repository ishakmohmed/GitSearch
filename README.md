[4] Intro: 
Search any GitHub user and see their data (such as stars per language, most forked repo, et cetera) presented to you with
beautiful visuals thanks to GitHub and FusionCharts' API. This web app is made using React, a popular frontend JavaScript library created
by Facebook in 2013 to build user interface. In this project, I've utilized a bunch of APIs such as FusionCharts' one to 
display the beautiful charts such as the Doughnut/Donut chart to display stars per language. This project is implemented 
with the new features in React such as the Context API, React Hooks, and so on. Also, the codes make use of ECMAScript 6
specifications such as object destructuring, template literals (wherever needed) instead of strings, spread and rest operators,
and so on. I hope you like this project, and if you're a recruiter reading this, hello there!

[5] Technologies/Features Used:
* Auth0 API (for authentication and authorization)

* React Icons
* React Styles Components
* Axios (library to make HTTP requests)
* FusionCharts API (to display beautiful charts)
